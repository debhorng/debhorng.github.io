<h1>Deb Horng Consulting</h1><h2>About</h2>

<p>I work with medical imaging (MRI, CT, PET, X-ray, etc.) in clinical trials for drug development. I have experience in implementing BICR at an imaging CRO, including RECIST 1.1 and novel applications. My former research has included fat/water MRI, MRI-PDFF (applications in NAFLD and NASH), and iron quantification MRI (T2*, T2, QSM). </p>

<p>I earned a PhD in Medical Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and an SB in Electrical Engineering from MIT. My last name is pronounced Hong.</p>

<p>I am available for scientific consulting on imaging in clinical trials, with expertise in drafting protocols and imaging manuals, literature reviews, training team members on imaging basics, and KOL/reviewer management. Software/scripting skills include OsiriX, ImageJ, Matlab, R (ggplot), DICOM viewers, jMRUI, LaTeX.</p>
