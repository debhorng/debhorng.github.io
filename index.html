<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My PhD work involved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for <a href="https://www.radiology.wisc.edu/research/LIRP/currentResearch.php">fat and iron</a>  quantification, with clinical applications in the liver. Traditional MRI is based on qualitative assessment of image contrast, like looking at a photograph for dark and bright spots. Newer quantitative magnetic resonance methods enable measurement of chemical levels in the body. Instead of an arbitrary image contrast, each location in the image corresponds to a measurable physical or biological quantity.
<p>Specifically, my thesis included <b>(1)</b> showing the <b>single-R2*</b> (R2* = 1/T2*) signal model for chemical shift-encoded fat quantification is valid over the range of  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmri.23835">normal</a> to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmri.25382">iron overloaded</a> liver; and <b>(2)</b> <a href="http://www.ismrm.org/16/program_files/O62.htm">introducing a novel method</a> for <b>background field removal</b> in QSM (quantitative susceptibility mapping. These projects involve parameter estimation and signal processing tools, such as Monte Carlo analysis.  
<p>In general, I am interested in processing data with quantitative, physics-based methods to learn more about human physiology and pathophysiology.
